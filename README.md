# NetworkTools

NetworkTools is a toolbox used for preparing data to conduct some experiments on proNet-core's algorithm.

NetworkTools includes functions below:
- extract data which are written in csv format
- convert user-item record to user-list(of items) record
- split all data into a training set and a testing set
- export proNet-core's training data format
- execute an experiment for certain embedding result (TODO: refactor, this file is messy)
